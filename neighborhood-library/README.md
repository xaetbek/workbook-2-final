# Neighborhood Library

This project is a Java console application that simulates a neighborhood library system. Users can check out and return books using an honor system. It keeps track of available and checked out books based on user input.

## ✨ Interesting Code Highlight

```java
  public void checkOut(String name) {
        if (!isCheckedOut) {
            isCheckedOut = true;
            checkedOutTo = name;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Book is already checked out to " + checkedOutTo);
        }
    }
```

## 💡 Why it's interesting
This method clearly handles the logic of checking out a book, but it also prevents users from checking out a book that's already checked out. It's a great example of simple yet effective control flow using conditionals to protect program behavior and ensure data integrity.
